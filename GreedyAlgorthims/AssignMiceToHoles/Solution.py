'''
There are N Mice and N holes that are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accomodate only 1 mouse.
The positions of Mice are denoted by array A and the position of holes are denoted by array B.
A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consumes 1 minute.

Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.
